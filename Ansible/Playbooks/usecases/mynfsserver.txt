- installation and configuration done with the ansible user

- connection based on ssh

- what do we need to know?

  - install the NFS server/client and utilities
  - export the shared directory (/etc/exports)
  - add our LA lab network (internal)
  - configure the filesystem export for read/write on known networks
    - disable any unknown network or user connectivity
  - start the NFS service
  - cron job to backup the filesystem
  - NFS client installs? - common role
    - NFS Client /etc/fstab configuration to mount the share on boot...?
